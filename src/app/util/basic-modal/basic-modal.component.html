  <div *ngIf="data['name'] === 'Cresta Spray View Victoria Falls'">
    <h3>{{ data['name'] }}</h3>
    <p>Topping the list of affordable Victoria Falls hotels, Cresta Sprayview offers stylish, well-appointed accommodation and a host of convenient facilities for business and leisure travelers alike.
      <br><br>
      Ideally situated just 20km from the recently-upgraded Victoria Falls International Airport, 1.4km from the entrance to the Victoria Falls Rainforest, and 1km from the central business district, it provides a fantastic launchpad from which to explore Africaâ€™s adventure capital. In fact, the hotel is so close to the action that when the Falls are in full flood, the spray can be seen from the hotel, hence the name â€˜Sprayviewâ€™.
      <br><br>
      Set on eight acres of manicured grounds in the heart of Victoria Falls, Cresta Sprayview Hotel features 65 rooms and suites for guests to choose from. Convenient in-room amenities include air-conditioning, Wi-Fi, satellite television, tea and coffee making facilities, personal safes, hairdryers, and universal plugs.
      <br><br>
      The hotel has 1 on-site restaurant and 2 bars, the Railway Cocktail Bar and Lounge and the Rainforest Bar. Alfresco dining beside the large swimming pool on mild evenings, with the Falls thundering in the background, is an experience to remember.
      <br><br>
      One of the best Victoria Falls hotels for business travelers, Cresta Sprayview Hotel boasts a business center with state-of-the-art conference facilities and Wi-Fi in all public areas. The two conferencing venues - The Green Room and The Think Tank - accommodate 80 delegates cinema style and 12 delegates boardroom style respectively.
      <br><br>
      With over 50 fantastic activities to choose from, there are plenty of ways to keep busy in Victoria Falls. A haven for adventure enthusiasts, this resort town offers everything from white water rafting and bungee jumping, to zip-lining across the Batoka Gorge and river boarding down the Zambezi.
      <br><br>
      For a more relaxing experience, opt for a leisurely river cruise, a helicopter flight over the Falls, a walk through the various curio markets, or a half-day canoe trip. Making it easy for guests to enjoy a guided or self-guided tour of the â€˜Smoke That Thundersâ€™, the hotel offers guests a complimentary shuttle service to and from the rainforest entrance at designated times. Visit the 24 hour reception desk at Cresta Sprayview Hotel to arrange these activities, and more.
      <br><br>
      Cresta Sprayview was established in 1968 by Gardini & Sons to provide affordable and yet comfortable accommodation for the weary traveler. The hotel was taken over by Cresta Hotels in 2013 and was completely remodeled to its modern present look
